     1	Overhead the albatross
     2	Hangs motionless upon the air
     3	And deep beneath the rolling waves
     4	In labyrinths of coral caves
     5	The echo of a distant time
     6	Comes willowing across the sand
     7	And everything is green and submarine
     8	
     9	And no one showed us to the land
    10	And no one knows the where's or why's
    11	But something stirs and something tries
    12	And starts to climb toward the light
