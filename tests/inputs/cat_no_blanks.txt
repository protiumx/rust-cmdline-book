     1	Overhead the albatross
     2	Hangs motionless upon the air
     3	And deep beneath the rolling waves
     4	In labyrinths of coral caves
     5	The echo of a distant time
     6	Comes willowing across the sand
     7	And everything is green and submarine

     8	And no one showed us to the land
     9	And no one knows the where's or why's
    10	But something stirs and something tries
    11	And starts to climb toward the light
